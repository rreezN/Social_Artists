This is the website for our final project in the DTU course Computational Social Science in the spring of 2022. The website can be found [here](https://AndreasLH.github.io/Social_Artists/) or the link in the descrption.


Most of the work for this repository has been performed in [another repository](https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/s194247/computational-social-science/tree/master/Project_Assignment). But for convenience it is also embedded in the Project_Assignment folder. This repo is mainly just for hosting the website.
